#when you press q, the output.avi file is available into the same folder as the app.py file

#replace the out variable with out = cv2.VideoWriter('outpy.mp4',cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MP4V'), 20.0, (frame_width,frame_height))
#im not sure this will work 
#maybe we can combine this one with appTwo.py
